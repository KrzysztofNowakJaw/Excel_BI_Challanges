#If v has more than two elements, then the indexing vector is too short.
#Hence, R will invoke the Recycling Rule and expand the index vector to the length of v, recycling its contents.
#That gives an index vector that is FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, and so forth.
#VoilÃ ! The final result is every second element of v.
